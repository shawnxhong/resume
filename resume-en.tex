\section{Projects}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Recipes sharing website - Backend}}{Flask, MongoDB, Redis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A recipes sharing website built by a group of 5 people. I am in charge of the backend whilst the other 4 frontend.
  \item RESTful API based backend services built on top of Flask. Swagger UI is used for documentation and API testing. JSON Web Token is applied for authentication.
  \item Built a Redis caching layer to cache hot data. Adopted cache aside structure to ensure the eventual consistency where data is deleted from the cache after updated in the main DB. Improved API responsing time from 100-200ms to 20-50ms with the caching layer applied.
  \item MongoDB is used as the main DB. The full text search function is built based on the index and search pipeline.
  \item Obtained full mark as the final project of the degree. Future plan is to deploy the application to cloud service, develop online chat function and message queue service.
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Markowitz portfolio optimization program}}{Numpy, Pandas}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and optimized a program for computing the maximized portfolio based on Markowitz model. Based on over 200 trading strategies, the history performance of each in a given period of term is analyzed to give the most optimal portfolio (minimized risk/maximized return/maximized Sharpe ratio).
  \item For multiple future commodities, the return/retracement ratio are largely improved from 2 - 3 to 4 -5 after applied with the computed optimized portfolio.
\end{itemize}


\datedsubsection{\textbf{Online Quiz website - Frontend}}{React}
\begin{itemize}
  \item An online quiz website. Functionalities for teachers' side include quiz creation \& edition, quiz progress control and history statistics summary. Students' side features include quiz participation and result summary.
  \item The single page application interact with backend APIs using AJAX request. 
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Wearable social distancing alerting program}}{C, Contiki}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Based on Contiki-OS, end device e.g. TI cc2650 communicate with each other via 802.15.4 in star topology local area network. Distances between two device are measured using received signal strength indicator. Close contact less than 2 meters is sent back to end server via TCP to record potential close contact.
